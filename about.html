            <p>  Hung Beats was created by Bobby (Eilbacher) and Robby
              (Francalangia), however both of them have since dropped the "y".
              For years the idea lived on Spotify and permeated the airways of
              Worcester MA from Holy Cross's radio station: WCHC 88.1. Now that
              we are older and have much more serious boughts with hangovers
               and scaries the need for hung beats has only increased. Below
               you can find the application WCHC made us throw together to earn
             the coveted Sunday 10AM spot and the creators themselves serving
             the Holy Cross and Worcester community by providing the beats that
             heal us all on those tough mornings. </p>

      <div class=footer-disclaimer> The creators of this playlist and website do not own any of this
        music. We pay for the use of the Spotify. We condemn the illegal
        use (pirating or whatever the kids are doing these days) of any
        music. We are very greatful for the artists that spend their time
        to create the music we use to get through these tough times
        (hangovers). The best way to get a hangover is to go to your favorite                  artist's show and then the best way to cure it is to come here and
        let the music reign over you. Support musicians.
