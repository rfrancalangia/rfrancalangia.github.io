This is the home of my gitHub pages site. All code here is mostly mine, with some of it 
drawn from open source projects. It is a constant work in progress, so please excuse its
raw appearance. If you have any questions about any of the listed projects or pages 
please contact me at rcfran17@g.holycross.edu.
