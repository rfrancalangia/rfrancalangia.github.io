This is a goofy website I made while I was playing around with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I made it for the Radio Show I had in college, which I've missed doing in post-grad life.
Hopefully you enjoy the feel of the songs. Hopefully I keep this up and keep adding new 
features to the site. The playlist itself is constantly growing and changing and if you find you
like the music give it a follow on spotify: hung beats w/bobby and robby (public).
